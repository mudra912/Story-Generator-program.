Following are the steps involved in this Random story generator project.

1. Import the random module, as it is a built-in module of python.  So, there’s no need to install it manually.

2.  Define several lists of phrases. Here, we have defined eight lists. We can define more also, it depends totally on our choice.

Sentence_starter – This list gives an idea about the time of the event.
character – This list tells about the main character of this story.
time – This list defines the exact day on which some incident has occurred.
story_plot – This list defines the plot of the story.
place – This list defines the place at which the incident occurred.
second_character – This list defines the second character of the story.
age – This list defines the age of the second character.
work – This list tells about the work the second character was doing.

3. With the help of random.choice() select an item from each list and concatenate the selected items to generate sentences for the story.

In this way, we can compile and run this code as many times as we want. And different short stories will be generated.
